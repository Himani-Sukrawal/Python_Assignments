        "Garbage Collection Overhead:\n",
        "Python uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection, which can introduce performance overhead, especially in large applications with many objects.\n",
        "The garbage collector might not run immediately, leading to potential memory spikes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reference Cycles:\n",
        "Objects that reference each other in a cycle (e.g., two objects pointing to each other) may not be cleaned up by reference counting alone.\n",
        "While Python’s cyclic garbage collector helps, managing these cycles can still be tricky.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Fragmentation:\n",
        "While Python’s memory management reduces fragmentation, it can still occur over time. This issue arises when small memory blocks are allocated\n",

        "Memory Leaks:\n",
        "Despite automatic memory management, memory leaks can occur if objects are unintentionally held in memory (e.g., through circular references that\n",
        "aren’t collected). This can lead to the application consuming more memory over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Object Management:\n",
        "Python’s automatic memory management is less efficient when dealing with large objects. For example, large data structures (like big lists or\n",

        "\n",

        "In applications that spend a lot of time waiting for external resources (like reading from files, making network requests, or waiting for database queries),\n",

        "\n",
        "Responsiveness in User Interfaces:\n",
        "For graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or interactive applications, multithreading can ensure that the main thread remains responsive to user actions while\n",
        "other threads handle tasks like background data processing or network communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrency:\n",
        "Multithreading allows multiple threads to run at the same time (in environments that support true parallelism, like multi-core CPUs). This can make applications\n",
        "more efficient by splitting tasks and executing them concurrently, though the extent of parallelism is limited in Python due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
        "for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Better Resource Utilization:\n",

        "for suitable workloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplified Program Structure:\n",
        "Multithreading helps organize programs that involve multiple tasks that can be executed concurrently, like data processing, web scraping, or performing\n",
