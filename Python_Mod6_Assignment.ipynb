        "Here are the key differences between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "A. Abstraction\n",
        "Abstraction is about hiding the complexity and showing only the essential features of an object or system. In other words, abstraction lets you focus on what an\n",
        "object does, rather than how it does it. It provides a simplified view by hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "The goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity and allow a programmer to work with a higher-level view of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "1. Hides implementation details.\n",

        "3. Often implemented using abstract classes or interfaces.\n",

        "B. Encapsulation\n",
        "Encapsulation is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It also refers to restricting\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows different classes to have methods with the same name, but each class can implement the method in its own way.\n",
        "When you call a method on an object, Python determines the correct method to execute based on the object's class, even if the method name is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "How It Works:\n",
        "1. A base class defines a method.\n",
        "2. Derived classes (subclasses) override the method to provide their own specific implementation.\n",
        "3. You can call the method on an object, and Python will use the appropriate method based on the object's class (this is runtime polymorphism).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "1. Same method name (speak), but different implementations in each subclass (Dog, Cat).\n",
        "2. Python uses runtime polymorphism to determine the correct method to call based on the actual object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why It's Useful:\n",
        "1. Flexibility: You can write more generic code that can work with objects of different types, but still calls the appropriate method for each object.\n",
